Machine learning models were developed to predict changes in periodontal probing depth after step II therapy using patient-, tooth-, and site-specific clinical covariates. While predictive performance based on routine clinical data remains limited, models can stratify periodontal sites into meaningful categories and estimate the probability of pocket improvement.
