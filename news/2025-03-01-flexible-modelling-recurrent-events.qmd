A flexible modelling approach to analyse time-varying exposures and recurrent events in team sports injuries, based on the piece-wise exponential additive mixed model. The effects of past high-intensity training loads may accumulate over time, and a penalty approach is proposed to identify the relevant time window at which past exposures impact current risk.
