*Artificial Intelligence Review*

Deep generative models such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in static medical imaging tasks. This systematic review synthesizes 20 peer-reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, offering a comprehensive analysis of generative model usage in angiographic imaging, covering tasks such as image generation, vessel segmentation, and stenosis detection.
