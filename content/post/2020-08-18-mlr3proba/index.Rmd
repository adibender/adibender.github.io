[**`mlr3proba`**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08080) is an add-on package in the **`mlr3`** universe that provides support for probabilistic regression. In this paper we focus on it's capabilities for machine learning based survival analysis. **`mlr3proba`** provides a clean interface to many learners and their evaluation using different measures (see [here](https://mlr3proba.mlr-org.com/) for an overview). The paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08080
